## üéØ Recommended Deployment Path

### For Production (Recommended)
**GCP Compute Engine + Cloud SQL**
- ‚úÖ Best value for money (~$35/month)
- ‚úÖ Full control and customization
- ‚úÖ Professional setup
- ‚è±Ô∏è Setup time: 45-60 minutes

**How to deploy:**
```bash
# 1. Prepare package
./deploy/prepare-deployment.sh

# 2. Follow GCP Compute Engine section in QUICK_START.md
```

### For Quick MVP/Testing
**AWS Elastic Beanstalk**
- ‚úÖ Fastest deployment (10-15 minutes)
- ‚úÖ Auto-scaling included
- ‚úÖ Managed infrastructure
- ‚è±Ô∏è Setup time: 10-15 minutes

**How to deploy:**
```bash
# Install EB CLI
pip install awsebcli

# Deploy (from app root)
eb init -p ruby-2.7 redmine-app --region us-east-1
eb create redmine-production --instance-type t3.small
eb deploy
eb open
```

## üí∞ Cost Estimates

### Monthly Costs (Small Production Setup)

| Component | AWS | GCP |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| Compute | $15 | $13 |
| Database | $15 | $10 |
| Storage | $4 | $2 |
| Network | $10 | $10 |
| **Total** | **~$45** | **~$35** |

### Ways to Reduce Costs
1. **Reserved Instances**: Save 30-70% with 1-year commitment
2. **Auto-scaling**: Scale down during off-hours
3. **Spot Instances**: Save up to 90% (for non-critical workloads)
4. **Right-sizing**: Start small, scale as needed
5. **Free Tier**: AWS/GCP offer 12 months free tier for new accounts

## ‚ö° Quick Commands Reference

### Prepare Deployment Package
```bash
cd /Users/muhsinzyne/work/redmine-dev/redmine
./deploy/prepare-deployment.sh
```

### Deploy to AWS Elastic Beanstalk

pip install awsebcli
eb init -p ruby-2.7 redmine-app
eb create redmine-production
eb deploy
```

### Deploy to GCP App Engine
```bash
gcloud app deploy

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Package Creation Fails
```bash
# Ensure you're in the right directory
cd /Users/muhsinzyne/work/redmine-dev/redmine

# Ensure dependencies are installed
bundle install --without development test

# Check Ruby version
ruby -v  # Should be 2.7.8
```

### Deployment Fails
```bash
# Check application logs
tail -f /var/www/redmine/log/production.log

# Check service status
sudo systemctl status redmine

# Restart services
sudo systemctl restart redmine
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Test database connection
mysql -h db-host -u username -p

# Check environment variables
cat /var/www/redmine/.env.production

# Verify database exists
mysql -h db-host -u username -p -e "SHOW DATABASES;"
```
