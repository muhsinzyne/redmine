# WorkProof System - Complete Summary

Everything you need to know about the simplified WorkProof time tracking system.

---

## ✅ **What You Have Now**

### **Simple Screenshot-Based Time Tracking**

**Concept:**
```
Every 5-10-15 minutes → Screenshot sent → work_proof created
                                              ↓
When user stops → Consolidate API → Count screenshots → Calculate time → Create time_entry
```

**That's it! No complex clock in/out logic.** ✨

---

## 📊 **Database Schema (Final)**

```sql
work_proofs:
  - id
  - project_id
  - issue_id
  - user_id
  - date
  - image_url          ← Screenshot URL (GCS or local)
  - activity_id        ← For time_entry categorization
  - description        ← Optional note
  - status             ← 'pending' or 'consolidated'
  - consolidated       ← Boolean flag
  - consolidated_at    ← Timestamp
  - time_entry_id      ← Links to created TimeEntry
  - created_at
  - updated_at
```

**Removed (not needed):**
- ❌ clocked_in_at
- ❌ clocked_out_at
- ❌ work_hours (calculated, not stored)

---

## 🔌 **API Endpoints**

### **1. Create Work Proof**
```
POST /projects/1/work_proofs.json

Form Data:
- image (file) - Screenshot
- issue_id (int) - Issue being worked on
- activity_id (int) - Activity type
- description (string, optional)
```

**Mobile app sends this every 5-10-15 minutes.**

---

### **2. Consolidate to Time Entry**
```
POST /projects/1/work_proofs/consolidate_by_issue.json

JSON:
{
  "issue_id": 5,
  "interval_minutes": 10  ← Default: 10
}
```

**Mobile app calls this when user stops working.**

---

## 🧮 **Time Calculation**

**Formula:**
```
Hours = (Number of Screenshots × Interval in Minutes) / 60
```

**Example:**
```
6 screenshots sent
Interval: 10 minutes
Calculation: 6 × 10 / 60 = 1.0 hour
```

---

## 📱 **Mobile App Workflow**

```dart
// 1. User starts work
tracker.startTracking(
  issueId: 5,
  activityId: 9,
  intervalMinutes: 10,
);

// 2. App automatically sends screenshot every 10 minutes
// (Handled by Timer in tracker)

// 3. User clicks "Stop Work"
final result = await tracker.stopTracking();
// Result: { hours: 1.5, screenshots: 9, time_entry_id: 42 }

// 4. Show user summary
showDialog('Tracked ${result['hours']} hours');
```

**That's all the mobile app needs to do!** ✅

---

## 🤖 **Auto-Consolidation (Safety Net)**

If user forgets to stop:
- Cron runs every hour
- Finds work_proofs created >4 hours ago
- Automatically consolidates them
- Creates time_entry
- User doesn't lose any tracked time

**Setup:**
```bash
# Crontab
0 * * * * cd /var/www/redmine && bundle exec rake work_proof:auto_consolidate RAILS_ENV=production
```

---

## 🎯 **Status Workflow**

**Simple 2-state workflow:**
```
pending → consolidated
   ↓            ↓
Screenshot   Converted to
  saved      time_entry
```

**No intermediate states!**

---

## ✅ **Current Features**

### **Implemented & Working**

✅ Screenshot upload to GCS
✅ Image compression (50-80% smaller)
✅ Activity_id tracking
✅ Simple status (pending/consolidated)
✅ Consolidation by counting
✅ Auto-consolidation (>4 hours)
✅ Time_entry creation
✅ Configurable intervals
✅ Graceful fallbacks
✅ Complete API
✅ Full documentation

---

## 📋 **Quick Reference**

### **Mobile App: Send Screenshot**
```
Every 10 min → POST /work_proofs
  - image: screenshot file
  - issue_id: current issue
  - activity_id: activity type
```

### **Mobile App: Stop & Consolidate**
```
User stops → POST /consolidate_by_issue
  - issue_id: current issue
  - interval_minutes: 10
```

### **System: Auto-Consolidate**
```
Cron (hourly) → rake work_proof:auto_consolidate
  - Finds old work_proofs (>4h)
  - Consolidates automatically
```

---

## 🧪 **Testing**

```bash
# 1. Start Rails
bundle exec rails server

# 2. Send 3 screenshots (Postman)
POST /work_proofs (with image, issue_id=1, activity_id=9)
POST /work_proofs (with image, issue_id=1, activity_id=9)
POST /work_proofs (with image, issue_id=1, activity_id=9)

# 3. Consolidate
POST /consolidate_by_issue
{ "issue_id": 1, "interval_minutes": 10 }

# 4. Check result
GET /time_entries.json?issue_id=1
# Should show: 0.5 hours (3 screenshots × 10min = 30min)
```
