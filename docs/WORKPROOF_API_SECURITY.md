# WorkProof API Security Documentation

Complete guide to WorkProof API authentication, authorization, and security.

---

## ‚úÖ **YES - The API is Fully Secured!**

The WorkProof API uses **Redmine's built-in API authentication system** with **role-based permissions**.

---

## üîê **Authentication Methods**

### **1. API Key (Recommended for Mobile Apps)**

**How it works:**
```bash
# Add API key to request header
curl -H "X-Redmine-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://track.gocomart.com/projects/1/work_proofs.json

# Or add as URL parameter
curl https://track.gocomart.com/projects/1/work_proofs.json?key=YOUR_API_KEY
```

**Your mobile app already uses this!**
```dart
network.post(
  '${NetworkURL.workProofSubmit}?key=${request.apiKey}',
  // ...
);
```

**Getting API Key:**
1. Login to Redmine web interface
2. Go to "My account" (top right)
3. Click "Show" under "API access key"
4. Copy the key

**API Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ Unique per user
- ‚úÖ Can be reset anytime
- ‚úÖ Never expires (unless reset)
- ‚úÖ User's permissions apply
- ‚úÖ Safe for mobile apps

---

### **2. HTTP Basic Authentication**

```bash
curl -u username:password \
  https://track.gocomart.com/projects/1/work_proofs.json
```

**Not recommended for mobile apps** (use API keys instead)

---

### **3. Session-based (Web)**

Uses cookies from web login. Only for web interface.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **Authorization & Permissions**

### **Permission Model**

The API has **3 permission levels**:

#### **1. View All Work Proofs** (`view_work_proof`)
**Who has it:** Admins, Managers, Project Leaders

**Can do:**
- ‚úÖ View all work proofs in project
- ‚úÖ Filter by any user
- ‚úÖ View statistics
- ‚ùå Cannot create/edit/delete

**API endpoints:**
```bash
GET /projects/1/work_proofs.json              # See all work proofs
GET /projects/1/work_proofs.json?user_id=5    # Filter by user
GET /projects/1/work_proofs/123.json          # View any work proof
```

---

#### **2. View Own Work Proofs** (`view_self_work_proof`)
**Who has it:** Regular users, team members

**Can do:**
- ‚úÖ View only their own work proofs
- ‚úÖ Filter by their own data
- ‚ùå Cannot see other users' work proofs
- ‚ùå Cannot create/edit/delete

**API endpoints:**
```bash
GET /projects/1/work_proofs.json              # See only their work proofs
GET /projects/1/work_proofs/123.json          # Only if they created it
```

**Security:**
```ruby
# Automatic filtering
WorkProof.where(project_id: @project.id, user_id: User.current.id)
```

---

#### **3. Manage Work Proofs** (`manage_work_proof`)
**Who has it:** Admins, Managers (assigned by admin)

**Can do:**
- ‚úÖ Create work proofs
- ‚úÖ Update work proofs
- ‚úÖ Delete work proofs
- ‚úÖ View all work proofs

**API endpoints:**
```bash
POST   /projects/1/work_proofs.json           # Create
PUT    /projects/1/work_proofs/123.json       # Update
DELETE /projects/1/work_proofs/123.json       # Delete
```

---

## üîí **Security Layers**

### **Layer 1: Authentication**

```ruby
accept_api_auth :index, :show, :create, :update, :destroy
```

**What it does:**
- ‚úÖ Requires valid API key or credentials
- ‚ùå Rejects unauthenticated requests
- ‚ùå Returns `401 Unauthorized` if no credentials

**Test:**
```bash
# Without API key - FAILS
curl https://track.gocomart.com/projects/1/work_proofs.json
# Response: 401 Unauthorized

# With API key - WORKS
curl -H "X-Redmine-API-Key: abc123" \
  https://track.gocomart.com/projects/1/work_proofs.json
# Response: 200 OK with data
```

---

### **Layer 2: Project Access**

```ruby
before_action :find_project
```

**What it does:**
- ‚úÖ Verifies project exists
- ‚úÖ Checks user has access to project
- ‚ùå Returns `404 Not Found` if project doesn't exist
- ‚ùå Returns `403 Forbidden` if user not member

**Test:**
```bash
# User not member of project 99 - FAILS
curl -H "X-Redmine-API-Key: abc123" \
  https://track.gocomart.com/projects/99/work_proofs.json
# Response: 403 Forbidden
```

---

### **Layer 3: Permission Check**

```ruby
before_action :check_permissions
```

**What it does:**
- ‚úÖ Checks user has `view_work_proof` OR `view_self_work_proof`
- ‚ùå Returns `403 Forbidden` if no permissions

```ruby
def check_permissions
  @can_monitor_work_proof = User.current.admin? || 
                            User.current.allowed_to?(:view_work_proof, @project)
  
  @can_view_self_work_proof = User.current.allowed_to?(:view_self_work_proof, @project)
  
  render_403 unless @can_monitor_work_proof || @can_view_self_work_proof
end
```

---

### **Layer 4: Action Authorization**

```ruby
before_action :authorize_global, only: [:create, :update, :destroy]
```

**What it does:**
- ‚úÖ For create/update/delete, requires `manage_work_proof` permission
- ‚ùå Returns `403 Forbidden` if not allowed

```ruby
def authorize_global
  unless User.current.admin? || User.current.allowed_to?(:manage_work_proof, @project)
    render_403
  end
end
```

**Test:**
```bash
# Regular user trying to create - FAILS
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-Redmine-API-Key: regular-user-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"work_proof": {"issue_id": 1}}' \
  https://track.gocomart.com/projects/1/work_proofs.json
# Response: 403 Forbidden

# Manager or admin - WORKS
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-Redmine-API-Key: manager-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"work_proof": {"issue_id": 1}}' \
  https://track.gocomart.com/projects/1/work_proofs.json
# Response: 201 Created
```

---

### **Layer 5: Data Filtering**

```ruby
def index
  @work_proofs = if @can_monitor_work_proof
    # Managers see all
    WorkProof.where(project_id: @project.id)
  elsif @can_view_self_work_proof
    # Regular users see only their own
    WorkProof.where(project_id: @project.id, user_id: User.current.id)
  end
end
```

**Security guarantee:**
- ‚úÖ Users can **NEVER** see other users' data without permission
- ‚úÖ Automatic filtering at database level
- ‚úÖ No SQL injection possible

---

### **Layer 6: Resource-level Access**

```ruby
def find_work_proof
  @work_proof = WorkProof.find(params[:id])
  
  # Check if user can access this specific work proof
  unless @can_monitor_work_proof || 
         (@can_view_self_work_proof && @work_proof.user_id == User.current.id)
    render_403
    return false
  end
end
```

**What it does:**
- ‚úÖ Regular users can only access their own work proofs
- ‚úÖ Managers can access any work proof
- ‚ùå Returns `403 Forbidden` if trying to access someone else's

**Test:**
```bash
# User ID 5 trying to view work proof created by User ID 10 - FAILS
curl -H "X-Redmine-API-Key: user5-key" \
  https://track.gocomart.com/projects/1/work_proofs/123.json
# Response: 403 Forbidden (if work proof belongs to user 10)
```

---

## üîë **Permission Configuration**

### **How to Assign Permissions**

**Via Web Interface:**

1. Login as admin
2. Go to **Administration ‚Üí Roles and permissions**
3. Select role (Manager, Developer, Reporter, etc.)
4. Find **WorkProof** section
5. Check permissions:
   - ‚òë View work proof (see all)
   - ‚òë View self work proof (see own)
   - ‚òë Manage work proof (create/edit/delete)
6. Save

**Recommended setup:**

| Role        | View All | View Own | Manage |
|-------------|----------|----------|--------|
| Admin       | ‚úÖ       | ‚úÖ       | ‚úÖ     |
| Manager     | ‚úÖ       | ‚úÖ       | ‚úÖ     |
| Developer   | ‚ùå       | ‚úÖ       | ‚ùå     |
| Reporter    | ‚ùå       | ‚úÖ       | ‚ùå     |

---

## üì± **Mobile App Security**

### **Your Mobile App Implementation**

```dart
Future<Response> postWorkProof(WorkProofRequest request, imagePath) async {
  FormData formData = FormData.fromMap({
    'image': await MultipartFile.fromFile(imagePath, ...),
    'project_id': request.projectId,
    'issue_id': request.issueId,
  });

  return network.post(
    '${NetworkURL.workProofSubmit}?key=${request.apiKey}',  // ‚úÖ API key auth
    data: formData,
  );
}
```

**Security checklist:**

‚úÖ **Using API key** (not passwords)
‚úÖ **HTTPS** (encrypted communication)
‚úÖ **User-specific key** (each user has their own)
‚úÖ **Server validates** (all security checks on server)

---

## üîê **Best Practices**

### **1. API Key Storage (Mobile Apps)**

**‚úÖ DO:**
```dart
// Store securely using flutter_secure_storage
final storage = FlutterSecureStorage();
await storage.write(key: 'api_key', value: apiKey);

// Retrieve when needed
String apiKey = await storage.read(key: 'api_key');
```

**‚ùå DON'T:**
```dart
// Don't hardcode in source code
String apiKey = "abc123def456";  // BAD!

// Don't store in SharedPreferences (not encrypted)
prefs.setString('api_key', apiKey);  // BAD!
```

---

### **2. HTTPS Only**

**‚úÖ Always use HTTPS:**
```dart
const baseUrl = 'https://track.gocomart.com';  // ‚úÖ HTTPS
```

**‚ùå Never use HTTP:**
```dart
const baseUrl = 'http://track.gocomart.com';  // ‚ùå Insecure!
```

**Your production already uses HTTPS!** ‚úÖ

---

### **3. API Key Rotation**

**Users can reset their API key:**
1. Login to Redmine
2. My account
3. Click "Reset" next to API access key
4. Old key immediately invalidated
5. New key generated

**Recommendation:**
- Rotate keys every 90 days
- Rotate immediately if device lost
- Rotate if suspicious activity

---

### **4. Input Validation**

**Already handled by Redmine:**

```ruby
def work_proof_params
  params.require(:work_proof).permit(
    :issue_id,
    :date,
    :image_url,
    :description,
    :work_hours,
    :status
  )
end
```

**Security:**
- ‚úÖ Strong parameters (whitelist)
- ‚úÖ SQL injection prevented
- ‚úÖ XSS prevented (auto-escaped in views)
- ‚úÖ File upload validation (image types only)

---

## üß™ **Security Testing**

### **Test Authentication**

```bash
# 1. Test without credentials - should FAIL
curl -v https://track.gocomart.com/projects/1/work_proofs.json
# Expected: 401 Unauthorized

# 2. Test with invalid API key - should FAIL
curl -H "X-Redmine-API-Key: invalid123" \
  https://track.gocomart.com/projects/1/work_proofs.json
# Expected: 401 Unauthorized

# 3. Test with valid API key - should WORK
curl -H "X-Redmine-API-Key: YOUR_REAL_KEY" \
  https://track.gocomart.com/projects/1/work_proofs.json
# Expected: 200 OK with data
```

---

### **Test Authorization**

```bash
# 1. Regular user trying to view all work proofs
# Should only see their own
curl -H "X-Redmine-API-Key: regular-user-key" \
  https://track.gocomart.com/projects/1/work_proofs.json
# Expected: Only their work proofs returned

# 2. Regular user trying to create work proof
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-Redmine-API-Key: regular-user-key" \
  https://track.gocomart.com/projects/1/work_proofs.json
# Expected: 403 Forbidden (unless has manage_work_proof permission)

# 3. Manager creating work proof
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-Redmine-API-Key: manager-key" \
  -F "image=@test.jpg" \
  https://track.gocomart.com/projects/1/work_proofs.json
# Expected: 201 Created
```

---

### **Test Data Isolation**

```bash
# User A trying to access User B's work proof
curl -H "X-Redmine-API-Key: userA-key" \
  https://track.gocomart.com/projects/1/work_proofs/999.json
# If work proof 999 belongs to User B: 403 Forbidden
# If work proof 999 belongs to User A: 200 OK
```

---

## üö® **Error Responses**

### **401 Unauthorized**
```json
{
  "errors": ["You are not authorized to access this page."]
}
```

**Causes:**
- No API key provided
- Invalid API key
- API key disabled/reset

**Solution:** Check API key, regenerate if needed

---

### **403 Forbidden**
```json
{
  "errors": ["You are not authorized to perform this action."]
}
```

**Causes:**
- Missing required permission
- Trying to access another user's data
- Not a member of the project

**Solution:** Check user permissions, assign correct role

---

### **404 Not Found**
```json
{
  "errors": ["The page you were trying to access doesn't exist."]
}
```

**Causes:**
- Project doesn't exist
- Work proof doesn't exist
- Wrong URL

---

## üìä **Security Audit Log**

Redmine logs all API access automatically:

```bash
# View API requests
tail -f /var/www/redmine/log/production.log | grep API

# Example log entries:
# API request by user 15 (john.doe)
# Processing WorkProofsApiController#create
# Completed 201 Created
```
